# Project 3: Calculator v3

## Objective







## Syntax Diagram

A **syntax diagram** is a graphical representation of a programming language's syntax rules. Basically, a syntax diagram visually shows you which statements are allowed in your programming language and which are not. Syntax diagrams serve two main purposes:

- They graphically represent the specification (grammar) of a programming language.
- They can be used to help you write your parser. You can map a diagram to code by following simple rules.

Here is an example:

![Syntax Diagram](Syntax_Diagram.png)

You can read the above syntax diagram as following: a term optionally followed by a plus or minus sign, followed by another term, which in turn is optionally followed by a plus or minus sign followed by another term and so on. According to the syntax diagram above, all of the following arithmetic expressions are valid:

- 3
- 3 + 4
- 7 - 3 + 2 - 1

Syntax diagrams serve two main purposes:

- They graphically represent the specification (grammar) of a programming language.
